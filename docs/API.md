# API contract

Base path /v1. JSON unless noted. Auth via the auth service's session. All errors use one envelope with a stable machine code and a user-safe message.

## Current React integration contract (2026-11-07)

Code is the authority. The endpoint table below also includes future scope; it is not a completion report.
Authentication uses existing SuperTokens `/auth/signup`, `/auth/signin`, `/auth/signout` and
`/auth/session/refresh`, with provider httpOnly cookies. Native fetch uses `rid`, `fdi-version`
and `st-auth-mode` headers. `/v1/me` is the session/profile check.
Only health/readiness and provider auth are public; legal and `/openapi.json` now require a session.

| Flow | Implemented contract |
|---|---|
| Profile/theme | GET/PATCH `/v1/me`; preferences `{theme: light,dark,system}`; server `prompts_left` |
| Conversations | POST `{mode}`; GET list `{items,next_cursor}`; GET detail `{messages}`; PATCH `{title}` |
| Message stream | POST `{content,mode}`; fetch SSE `meta`, `delta:{text}`, `citations`, `done`, `error` |
| Category counts | GET `/v1/templates/categories` → `{items:[{name,count}],total}` |
| Search/page | GET `/v1/templates?q=&category=&limit=9&cursor=0` → `{items,total,next_cursor}`; numeric offset cursor |
| Field schema | GET `/v1/templates/{slug}` → title, category, slug, version, status, is_fake, fields |
| Template prefill | POST `/v1/drafting/prefill` `{description,conversation_id?}` → `{slug,values,missing_fields,confidence,prompts_left,draft}`; one prompt, failures refunded |
| Restore form | GET `/v1/conversations/{id}/draft` → draft snapshot or JSON null; owner only |
| Autosave form | PATCH same route `{slug,version,values,revision}` → updated snapshot; revision 0 creates, stale revision returns 409 |
| Preview | POST `/v1/templates/{slug}/render` `{values,format:"html"}` → `{html}`; escaped values in `.v` spans |
| Generate | Same route, `format:"docx"`, optional conversation_id/version/draft_revision → document metadata; draft link requires matching version, revision and values |
| Restore document | GET `/v1/documents/{id}` → `{id,name,slug,fields,values,filename,html}`; owner only |
| Download | GET `/v1/documents/{id}/download` → 307, five-minute signed private URL; owner only |
| Feedback | POST `/v1/feedback` `{category,message,conversation_id?}` → 204; stored, owner checked |
| Legal | GET `/v1/legal/{terms,privacy}` → existing owner/fake document JSON |

Field definitions use `{key,label,example,max_length}`. Development draft catalog serving requires
ALLOW_UNAPPROVED_TEMPLATES; fake records never become approved. Generation, download and downstream API smoke assertions pass locally; see STATUS.md. No new screens are implied by existing backend routes.

Prefill considers only approved non-FAKE templates. Extracted values must be literal substrings of the
description or the last eight user messages in that owned conversation (prior facts capped at 6000 characters).
Missing facts remain null/blank. Low confidence returns slug null. Threshold is set by
DRAFTING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD. Prefill shares chat's hourly/concurrent limits and atomic quota ledger.
Draft reads/writes also use the existing authenticated request rate limit. Editing a generated draft clears
its active download reference; prior generated documents remain immutable and available in chat history.

## Error codes
unauthenticated (401), email_unverified (403), forbidden (403), not_found (404), validation_failed (422), quota_exhausted (402), rate_limited (429, with retry-after), model_unavailable (503), content_blocked (422), conflict (409), internal (500).
Uploads: unsupported_file (422), file_too_large (413), unreadable_document (422), document_rejected (422), upload_quota_exceeded (429).

## Streaming message contract
Request creates the user message, consumes one prompt through the ledger, then streams. Event order:
1. meta: user message id, assistant message id, prompts_left.
2. delta: text chunks. Repeat.
3. citations: verified citations only, sent once after the text completes. The text is not final until verification passes (RAG_AND_GUARDRAILS.md section 5).
4. done: finish reason and token counts.
5. error: code and message, then close. A refund occurs if no delta was sent.
Server requirements: heartbeat comment every 15 seconds, cancel the upstream model call when the client disconnects, persist the assistant message in a final state even on partial failure (marked incomplete), disable proxy buffering.

## Rate limits (starting values, tune with load tests)
Per user: 30 messages per hour, 2 concurrent streams. Per IP: 120 requests per minute. Auth endpoints: 10 attempts per 15 minutes per IP and per account. Feedback: 10 per hour. Uploads: per D14.
