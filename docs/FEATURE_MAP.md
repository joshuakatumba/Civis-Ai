# Frontend feature to backend map

Every visible feature appears here. If a frontend feature is missing from this table, it must not be built. If a row says NONE, the feature is client-only.

## Account and access
| Frontend feature | Backend | Endpoint or job | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing page, Sign up | Auth service | Auth SDK routes (signup) | Collect name, email, password. Must show and record consent to Terms and Privacy (version id). |
| Landing page, Log in | Auth service | Auth SDK routes (signin) | Generic error on failure. Never reveal whether an email exists. |
| Email verification | Auth service plus transactional email | Auth SDK routes | Unverified users get zero prompts. This is the main anti-abuse control. |
| Password reset | Auth service plus email | Auth SDK routes | Frontend pages needed (not in the prototype). |
| Logout (menu, confirm) | Auth service | Auth SDK signout | Revokes the session server-side. |
| Account row (email, initial) | API | GET /v1/me | |
| "X of 20 free prompts left" | API | GET /v1/me, and SSE meta event | Server is the only source of the count. Never compute locally. |
| Theme toggle (Dark mode) | API | PATCH /v1/me | Stored in preferences. Client also caches for first paint. |
| Delete account (new, required) | API plus worker | DELETE /v1/me | Not in the prototype. Data protection requires it. Asynchronous purge job. |

## M2 frontend changes (after M1 foundations)
Owner approved M1 foundations before the M2 rebuild on 2026-11-07; this resolves the original ordering conflict with BUILD_PLAN.md.
Rebuild as a Next.js app. Add: stop button, delete chat, feedback thumbs, citation display, all error states, email verification screen, password reset screens, delete-account and export in settings, consent checkbox on signup. Remove the prototype's localStorage auth and in-browser Word generation.
