# Civis complete product-readiness task register

Audited 2026-11-09 against current code, STATUS.md, KNOWN_ISSUES.md and the product specifications.
Scope: all documented product capabilities and reliability work. AWS deployment, VM sizing,
DNS/TLS setup, server provisioning and infrastructure operations are intentionally excluded.
The original audit was read-only; the testing-slice updates below record subsequent implementation and local checks.

There are **188 acceptance tasks** in this register: 9 completed for the local testing/tooling scope, 179 open. An open task may complete or verify
an existing foundation; it does not mean the entire subsystem is absent. Counts are not an
estimate of effort or a percentage-complete score. [OWNER] means an owner/advocate/provider input
is required; the agent must not fabricate legal content, access rights or acceptance thresholds.

The basic account/chat/history/quota/template-render/download flows have passed earlier local
fake-data integration checks. Reuse those foundations. A fake-data pass is not evidence of real
legal research/drafting quality. Implementation tasks below are proposed work, not permission to
redesign the frozen JSX, add arbitrary dependencies or bypass content approval.

Payments are a release dependency if charging; upload analysis is a release dependency if offered.
Hosted retrieval versus a local index is unresolved: do not build both by default. Choosing hosted
retrieval would require an explicit update to the existing local-index specification.

## Testing slice completed after this audit

On 2026-11-09 the owner approved the original templates for testing and authorised Groq.
Real Groq streaming/recall, 62 unchanged template imports and bounded conversation context now pass
local checks. Approved-version selection was corrected. See CORE_TESTING.md and STATUS.md.
Approved-template prefill and encrypted unfinished-form autosave now pass local API/live Groq/browser checks.
Version pinning and stale generated-file links are fixed. Nine implemented tasks are checked below;
these local results do not close source-verified RAG, privacy/customer lifecycle or complete release acceptance.

## Code evidence and concrete gaps

- `apps/api/civis/chat.py`: calls the provider without retrieval and emits an empty citations list.
- `apps/api/civis/templates.py`: now imports the 62 owner-approved testing templates; approved-version selection is corrected. The UI pins the selected version through draft saves and generation.
- `apps/web/src/components/Shell.jsx`: server-backed draft autosave/reload and edit invalidation now pass; broad multi-tab/concurrency acceptance remains open.
- `apps/api/civis/templates.py` field validation currently checks field keys and length; typed/required/cross-field rules are not implemented.
- `apps/worker/civis_worker.py`: only health_job exists; no ingestion, extraction, purge, export, reconciliation or support-delivery jobs.
- `.github/workflows/m1.yml` still invokes frontend scripts absent from `apps/web/package.json`.
- `evals/retrieval.py` now implements ranking metrics/coverage with FAKE exclusion; approved datasets and real ranked results remain missing. Generation/safety evaluation is still incomplete.
- Current legal route requires authentication while the older API table says public; signup/legal-access behavior needs an explicit resolution before implementation.
- This workspace contains an untracked SSH-key filename and nested checkout; no private key contents were read. Never stage these with product work.

## DEC — Product and owner decisions

Current state: Owner decisions; do not silently adopt defaults.

- [ ] DEC-01 [OWNER] Confirm release scope: research, approved drafting, uploaded-document analysis and paid plans; mark any unshipped capability unavailable.
- [ ] DEC-02 [OWNER] Confirm corpus sources/access rights (D9), provider collection coverage, attribution, storage/caching permissions and update access.
- [ ] DEC-03 [OWNER] Choose hosted retrieval or a maintained local index from a common benchmark; choose embeddings/reranker only if required (D10).
- [ ] DEC-04 [OWNER] Approve answer-quality, retrieval, abstention, safety, latency and cost acceptance thresholds.
- [ ] DEC-05 [OWNER] Confirm free allowance, spending/refund rules, plan entitlements, prices and payment provider (D3-D7).

- [ ] SAF-10 Record policy outcomes without private text and create a review path for false refusals and missed unsafe responses.

## TPL — Template import, review and catalog

Current state: Catalog and fake seed exist; approved-content lifecycle is missing.

- [x] TPL-01 Build an owner-run import command for supplied real template definitions; an admin upload UI is optional, not required to import.

Current state: Basic server HTML/OOXML generation and private downloads work locally.

- [ ] DOC-01 Validate real templates with required fields, date/amount types, Unicode and XML-forbidden/control characters.
- [ ] DOC-02 Generate preview and Word text from one pinned template/value snapshot and test equivalence.
- [ ] DOC-03 Confirm required Word formatting, numbering, tables, page breaks and signatures against each supported template; document unsupported layouts.

- [ ] UPL-15 Implement expiry/deletion/account-purge cascades and prove original/text/chunk/vector removal.
- [ ] UPL-16 Test isolation, zip bombs, corruption, hidden instructions, failures/refunds and maximum-size cost; keep OCR off until its separate benchmark passes.

## ACC — Accounts, sessions and consent

Current state: Provider auth works; complete customer recovery/verification flows are missing.

- [ ] ACC-01 Add provider-owned email verification screens, resend/status handling and verified-only allowance behavior.
- [ ] ACC-02 Add provider-owned password-reset request/completion screens and expired/used-token handling.

- [ ] ACC-07 Test session expiry/refresh races, revoked sessions, logout during work and multiple tabs.
- [ ] ACC-08 Test CSRF, cookie and origin protections against authenticated state-changing endpoints.
- [ ] ACC-09 Enforce disabled/deleted-account access restrictions and revoke provider sessions during deletion.
- [ ] ACC-10 Ensure frontend API outages are distinguished from unauthenticated state; retain safe no-browser-credential storage behavior.

## CHAT — Conversation and frontend completeness

Current state: Basic flows pass locally; several specified controls and state cases are missing.

- [ ] CHAT-01 Add stop-generation control using cancellation; preserve correct incomplete state and refund behavior.
- [ ] CHAT-02 Add stored citation/source display and useful verified-answer formatting without interpreting arbitrary model HTML.
- [ ] CHAT-03 Connect existing per-message feedback API to thumbs/review interactions.
- [ ] CHAT-04 Add conversation rename/delete controls and their retention behavior.

- [ ] CHAT-08 Keep history genuinely paged, prevent duplicate empty conversations and handle large/long histories.
- [ ] CHAT-09 Cover loading, empty, offline, failure, incomplete, verification-required, rate-limit and quota-exhausted states; preserve unsent text on failure.
- [ ] CHAT-10 Check keyboard/mobile/accessibility, long answers, auto-scroll, reconnects and unsupported browser voice/install behavior; only advertise PWA install if implemented.

## QUO — Quota, rate limits and abuse controls

Current state: Atomic ledger and races pass; all new model-consuming paths still need integration.

- [ ] QUO-01 Confirm displayed allowance/plan labels come from server entitlements, including future paid plans.
- [ ] QUO-02 Extend spending/refunds to prefill and document analysis while keeping render/download free as approved.
- [ ] QUO-03 Add request idempotency across client retries/reconnects; existing server-generated message IDs do not prevent duplicate submissions.
- [ ] QUO-04 Test concurrent tabs, duplicate requests, cancellation, pre/post-first-token failure and account ownership for every spending path.
- [ ] QUO-05 Implement specified per-user feedback and upload limits in addition to general IP/message limits.
- [ ] QUO-06 Test proxy/client identity handling so distinct customers do not accidentally share a single proxy-IP auth limit.
- [ ] QUO-07 Implement bounded provider/conversation concurrency and accurate recovery of leases after worker/API failures.
- [ ] QUO-08 Apply model-output/input limits and account/global spend protection without bypassing the ledger.
- [ ] QUO-09 Validate allowance changes, grants, refunds and paid entitlement expiry with auditable reconciliation.

- [ ] PAY-06 Handle duplicate, delayed, replayed and out-of-order payment events idempotently.
- [ ] PAY-07 Grant entitlements atomically only after verified payment; never trust a browser success redirect.
- [ ] PAY-08 Implement entitlement expiry, failed/cancelled payment behavior and appropriate refund/reversal handling.
- [ ] PAY-09 Reconcile provider transactions with local events and make support investigations possible without exposing payment secrets.
- [ ] PAY-10 Test forged callbacks, double payment, amount/currency/plan mismatches and quota grants end to end.

## PRI — Privacy, authorization and data lifecycle

Current state: Ownership/encryption/log redaction foundations exist; lifecycle is incomplete.

- [ ] PRI-02 Implement account data export with owner-only expiring delivery.
- [ ] PRI-03 Implement account deletion, session revocation and complete data-purge worker jobs.
- [ ] PRI-04 Implement approved conversation/document/upload retention and explain pending/failed deletion states.
- [ ] PRI-05 Define auditable handling of retained payment/audit records with owner/counsel input rather than guessing obligations.
- [ ] PRI-06 Test deletion races against streams, jobs, exports and regenerated documents; prevent deleted content from reappearing.
- [ ] PRI-07 Check redaction across application/provider/error/trace paths; permit content review only through an approved consent/access process.
- [ ] PRI-08 Create least-privilege reviewer/admin authorization and audit records for imports, approvals, exports, deletion and entitlement changes.
- [ ] PRI-09 Review HTML/XML injection, signed-link leakage, object ownership and sensitive file names; add meaningful abuse tests.
- [ ] PRI-10 Keep development keys/SSH private keys out of Git and build contexts; audit dependencies and resolve applicable security findings.

## SUP — Support, approved content and secondary promises

Current state: Feedback is stored; support delivery/review and approved content are incomplete.

- [ ] SUP-01 Replace placeholder legal pages, disclaimers, referrals and other legal copy with owner-approved versioned files.
- [ ] SUP-02 Wire stored feedback to the approved support destination with bounded, idempotent delivery/retries.
- [ ] SUP-03 Provide a controlled way to inspect/resolve support tickets and flag inaccurate/harmful answers.
- [ ] SUP-04 Build a documented process for correcting templates/sources and identifying affected saved outputs.
- [ ] SUP-05 Check landing/Subscribe/install/voice/invite/share wording against actual shipped capabilities; retain link-only referrals unless rewards are approved.
- [ ] SUP-06 Complete promised PWA behavior and browser support testing if advertised; otherwise explicitly scope it out of the release.

## EVA — Evaluation, tests and CI

Current state: Local fake-model smoke passes; complete AI quality evidence and current CI wiring are missing.

- [ ] EVA-01 Repair CI commands that still reference removed Next.js npm scripts; use plain-JS/Vite checks without changing framework or adding unapproved dependencies.
- [ ] EVA-02 Commit a reproducible browser acceptance harness; current integration browser checks were run from a temporary external QA directory.
- [ ] EVA-03 [OWNER] Supply advocate-reviewed research golden set, passage relevance labels, safety cases and document QA fixtures; legal fixture content must not be invented.
- [ ] EVA-04 Build a versioned evaluation dataset format and frozen held-out test split; exclude fake fixtures from reported legal-quality scores.
- [x] EVA-05 Implement retrieval Recall@K, MRR/nDCG and coverage evaluation with explicit relevance judgments.
- [ ] EVA-06 Run generator-with-expert-context separately from full-pipeline evaluation to diagnose retrieval versus generation errors.
- [ ] EVA-07 Evaluate claim support, completeness, factual/legal correctness, citation precision/recall and abstention separately.
- [ ] EVA-08 Calibrate any LLM judge against advocates; report disagreement and uncertainty rather than a single opaque score.
- [ ] EVA-09 Test adversarial injection, conflicting/stale sources, missing facts, language/jurisdiction limits and unsupported questions.
- [ ] EVA-10 Test real template outputs, hostile values, preview/Word text equality, supported formatting and generation idempotency.
- [ ] EVA-11 Run current full unit/integration/browser suites, real Postgres/Redis/storage ownership/race checks and reversible migrations in CI.
- [ ] EVA-12 Gate content/model/prompt/retrieval changes on accepted baselines; include representative concurrency, fault and recovery tests without hiding skipped live checks.

## OBS — Product-level quality and incident feedback

Current state: Sanitized tracing hooks exist; answer-quality instrumentation is incomplete.

- [ ] OBS-01 Record request outcome, model/prompt/corpus/template versions, retrieval IDs/scores, verifier removals and abstention decisions.
- [ ] OBS-02 Measure time to first useful answer, total latency, token usage, per-feature cost and errors separately.
- [ ] OBS-03 Instrument and review unexpected abstention, fabricated-authority detections, broken generation and quota complaints.
- [ ] OBS-04 Implement consent-aware advocate sampling/review and feed confirmed failures back into frozen regression cases.
- [ ] OBS-05 Define triage, correction, feature disablement and user-support handling for confirmed harmful/incorrect outputs.
- [ ] OBS-06 Define graceful product behavior for unavailable model/retrieval/storage/scanner services; no silent fake success.

## REL — Product acceptance and release evidence

Current state: No complete real-content release evidence exists.

- [ ] REL-01 Freeze an exact release feature list and remove or disable promises for anything unfinished.
- [ ] REL-02 Demonstrate research using approved real sources with inspectable verified citations and correct abstention.
- [ ] REL-03 Demonstrate approved template selection/prefill/edit/preview/generate/download/reopen with no invented facts or wording drift.
- [ ] REL-04 Demonstrate complete account recovery, consent, privacy requests, quota and paid/upload flows for every feature actually offered.
- [ ] REL-05 Collect passing CI/evaluation reports and owner/advocate acceptance of the release sample; document remaining limitations explicitly.

## Suggested execution order (not a change to CI gates)

1. DEC + EVA foundations: resolve actual owner inputs, repair current CI, define dataset/schema and acceptance gates.
2. COR/ING/RET/GEN/CIT/SAF: build a verified research vertical slice, measure it, then broaden approved coverage.
3. TPL/PRE/DOC: replace fake templates, complete approved versioning and grounded drafting, fix state/version defects.
4. ACC/CHAT/QUO/PRI/SUP/OBS: complete customer flows and lifecycle in parallel only where dependencies permit.
5. PAY and UPL: finish before advertising/selling the corresponding capabilities; keep disabled otherwise.
6. REL: pass the agreed real-content checks and record release acceptance.

These are task dependencies, not an assurance that everything can be finished today. Product readiness
requires content, credentials, decisions and review in addition to implementation. Do not start a new
milestone contrary to BUILD_PLAN CI gates without the owner explicitly changing that requirement.
